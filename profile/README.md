### What is The Quake Shack about?

It’s about learning modern browser features, JavaScript and game engines.

This is an educational and recreational project.

Though the vision is to provide an id tech 2 based game engine running in the browser for fun multiplayer projects.
The engine is supposed to be extensible and fun to work with. Made for boomer shooter enthusiasts.

### Contribution

If you are interesting in joining the party, join us over at the IRC channel #quakeshack on hackint.

### What next?

There’s a game repository containing a JavaScript reimplementation of the original Quake game logic.

The engine repository contains everything you need including a shareware copy of Quake 1.

### Random stuff

There are some videos about the development process on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGPcWgDApoPigbHfFsRSfePs4DPINRGs2).
