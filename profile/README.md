## Welcome!

### What is The Quake Shack about?

It’s about learning modern browser features, JavaScript and game engines.

This is an educational and recreational project.

Though the vision is to provide an id tech 2 based game engine running in the browser for fun multiplayer projects.
The engine is supposed to be extensible and fun to work with. Made for boomer shooter enthusiasts.
